## Development Workflow

1. **Branch Naming**

   - Feature: `feature/description`
   - Bug fix: `fix/description`
   - Enhancement: `enhance/description`

2. **Code Standards**

   - Use TypeScript strict mode
   - Follow ESLint rules
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Add comments for complex logic

3. **Component Guidelines**

   - Create reusable components
   - Use TypeScript for props
   - Follow naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
   - Keep components in appropriate directories

4. **Styling**

   - Use TailwindCSS utility classes
   - Follow the design system colors
   - Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
   - Test on multiple screen sizes

5. **Testing** (when implemented)
   - Write unit tests for utilities
   - Test components with different props
   - Verify accessibility features
